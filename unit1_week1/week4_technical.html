		<h2> Enumerable Methods in Ruby </h2>
		<h3> April 25, 2014 </h3>
		<h4> <em>Enumerable#Map</em> </h4>
		<p>
			#Map is a very useful method that runs an attached block on every element of the array it is called on.   It returns a new array, meaning that the method is non-destructive.

			The following is an example of using enumerable#map to create a new array that squares every member of the array.
		</p>
		<div class = "code">
			my_array = [1, 2, 3, 4]<br/>
			my_array.map { |x| x ** 2 }
		</div>
		<p> 
			In the above example, the code block is instructing the method to raise every element, x, to the second power.  If you run this code in IRB, you will get a new array with values [1, 4, 9, 16].  However, because the method is non-destructive, my_array remains unchanged.  I tested this in the following way and got two separate arrays, which I expected.
		</p>
		<div class = "code">
			my_array = [1, 2, 3, 4]<br/>
			new_array = my_array.map { |x| x ** 2 }<br/>

			p my_array <span class = "comment"># This still equals [1, 2, 3, 4]</span><br/>
			p new_array <span class = "comment"># This is newly created and equals [1, 4, 9, 16]</span>

		</div>
		<p>
			#Map is useful for repeating the same code on every member of an array instead of having to write a loop to iterate through every item in an array.  Note that #Map is exactly the same as #Collect, another enumerable method, only with a different name.
		</p>
		<h4> <em>Enumerable#Group_by</em> </h4>
		<p>
			#Group_by, as its name implies, takes the elements in an array and groups them according to a condition specified in a block.  The resulting groups are output in a hash where the "group" that is the result of the condition is the key, and an array with all elements of the original array that satisfy the condition is the value.
		</p>
		<div class = "code">
			<span class = "comment"> # Group by if divisible by 2 </span><br/>
			my_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]<br/>
			my_array.group_by { |x| x%2 }<br/>
			<span class = "comment"> # => returns {0=>[2, 4, 6], 1=>[1, 3, 5]}</span><br/><br/>
			<span class = "comment"> # Group by first letter </span><br/>
			my_array = ["one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]<br/>
			my_array.group_by { |x| x[0] }<br/>
			<span class = "comment"> # => returns {"o"=>["one"], "t"=>["two", "three"], "f"=>["four", "five"], "s"=>["six"]} </span>
		</div>
		<p>
			The obvious use that comes to me for #Group_by is to categorize items in an array by letter.  For example, on many websites you can view products by letter.  So clicking a link to "A" products would bring up a list of all products beginning with the letter "A."  This type of categorization can be done with #Group_by.
		</p> 

		</div>
		<h4> <em>Enumerable#Cycle</em> </h4>
		<p>
			#Cycle is a handy method that will execute a code block on every element in an array a certain amount of times.  However, if an amount of times is not specified, the block will iterate <strong>FOREVER</strong>.  This is a design flaw, in my opinion, so always remember to specify a number of times to repeat!

			The method will return a value of nil if the code executes without error.
		</p>
		<div class = "code">
			my_array = [1, 2, 3, 4]<br/>
			my_array.cycle { |x| print x } <span class = "comment"> # This will run FOREVER </span><br/>
			my_array.cycle(2) { |x| print x } <span class = "comment"> # This will execute the code block twice </span><br/>
			<span class = "comment"> # => returns "12341234" </span>
		</div>
		<p>
			Honestly I'm not sure exactly when #Cycle would be very useful other than simply repeating something multiple times.  I was trying to see if I could get the cycles to "stack" on each other using math functions (for example, putting x * 2 in the block would multiply by 2 each cycle), but that did not work as I expected.  So if you have any ideas, email me :).
