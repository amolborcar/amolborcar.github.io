		<strong>Exercise 1:</strong> The terms that come to mind are Accomplishment, Adventure, Decisiveness, Growth, and Personal Development.  These all have to do with my feelings of restlessness whenever I feel like I'm not growing or developing in some way and are all part of the basis for my doing Dev Bootcamp.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong> Exercise 2:</strong> Growth is something that is important to me. I feel like everyone, especially people who are around my age, should be constantly learning from their experiences and the experiences of those around them and try to implement what they learn into their lives.   For example, even though my situation has not changed much, I feel like I am a much different person than I was even a year ago.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong> Exercise 3: </strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Accomplishment: 4 </li>
			<li>Adventure: 3 (though more so lately) </li>
			<li>Decisiveness: 3 (again, trying to be more decisive now) </li>
			<li>Growth: 4 </li>
			<li>Personal Development: 4 (similar to my feelings on growth)</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

		<strong> Exercise 4:</strong> The last topic someone asked my advice on was something related to my decision to leave my previous job and do DBC.  I talked to quite a few people about this and why it was the right decision for me and was interested in how many people agreed with the reasoning behind my decision, even if they admitted they wouldn't do something similar.
