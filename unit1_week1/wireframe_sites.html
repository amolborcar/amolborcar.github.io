		The first site I wireframed is the homepage for <a href = "http://www.espn.go.com" target = "_blank"> ESPN.com</a>, which provides sports news, scores, and highlights.  The "problem" the webpage is solving is how to provide the most sports information as possible, while at the same time display intriguing stories and videos that people will click on.  Visually, this is difficult because there are so many different sports and events going on at a given time they can choose to highlight.  They also want to keep the page well organized so people can easily find information they desire. <br/> <br/>

		The second site I wireframed is the homepage for <a href = "http://www.nytimes.com" target = "_blank"> The New York Times</a>.  The site provides U.S. and world news on a variety of topics.  The website serves as the online presence for the newspaper, so I think the problem the site is trying to solve is how to provide a user experience that is similar to what a reader would get from the newspaper.  Visually, the designer wants to create a website that is easy and pleasurable to read while also making it easy for the reader to navigate to other sections of the site. <br/> <br/>

		The final site I wireframed is a blog post for <a href = "http://www.gizmodo.com" target = "_blank"> Gizmodo</a>.  I think the problem for each individual post is how to display the information in the post elegantly while still allowing the reader to easily navigate to the homepage and to other posts in the site's network.  Gizmodo and the other sites in its network change their layout every few months, which I personally don't mind but many readers don't like.  Visually, the designer attemped to accomplish this by keeping the navigation sidebar on screen at all times, whether you are on the homepage or viewing a specific post, with the items in the sidebar periodically updating. <br/> <br/>
