	<h1> My Favorite Websites </h1>
	<h2> ESPN </h2>
	<p> 
		The website I visit most is <a href = "http://www.espn.go.com" target = "_blank"> ESPN.com </a>.  It is my go-to website for sports news and I check it several times a day, on my phone and on a computer, and often read several articles or features at a time.<br/>
		The first thing I notice when I enter the website is a large image in the front that changes every 5-10 seconds with the day's headline.  Usually the image will be accompanied by 3-4 links to stories or videos.  There is also a sidebar next to the headline graphic with the other top stories.  Because the topic is always sports or entertainment related, the site has a very light atmosphere and a lot of pictures and videos, plus a lot of links and advertisements of different colors. <br/>
		The site is very easy to navigate in my opinion, each sports has its own "homepage" that can be accessed from the main website as well as almost any other page you link to.  I visit the site often enough to know how to navigate it without really thinking about it, so I think it is easy to see all the content, although some pages are hidden inside special "insider" sections that are not freely available.

	<h2> The New York Times </h2>

	<p> 
		Another website I visit is <a href = "http://www.nytimes.com" target = "_blank"> The New York Times </a>.  The New York Times is now the site I visit most often for news and I think it does a great job of highlighting stories that I feel are important or interesting. <br/>
		The layout of the site is very plain, with a white background and black text.  On the front there are a few graphics, such as for weather or stock market information, but mostly the first thing I see is text and links to full articles that are the day's headlines.  After scrolling or reading further I see links to different sections of the site, such as Technology, Opinion, World, etc. and links to the site's most popular videos.  There is also a sidebar containing the day's top stories and a selection of stories "recommended for you."<br/>
		I enjoy the simplistic nature of the site specifically because it serves its purpose and does not add too much flash or frills.  I visit the site when I want to read the news, and the front page does a great job of that.  It is a white background with black text, similar to a newspaper, without any distracting videos, images, or advertisements (the front page contains only one small video clip).  If I do want to view multimedia or less serious subjects, I can scroll down or easily visit another section and find those things easily.  I often contrast this site to other news sites such as <a href = "http://www.cnn.com" target = "_blank"> CNN.com </a> or <a href = "http://www.huffingtonpost.com" target = "_blank"> The Huffington Post </a> which are sites I used to visit more often, but they have started putting what I feel are distracting visuals front and center, which I do not typically enjoy viewing when it comes to reading actual news.

	<h2> Gizmodo </h2>
	<p>
		A third website I visit often is <a href = "http://www.gizmodo.com" target = "_blank"> Gizmodo </a>.  Gizmodo is a blog that posts about technology and how it relates to society or trends in society.  It is also part of a network of websites that I also visit often (Deadspin, Gawker, IO9, Lifehacker).  I like the site because it covers a variety of topics and is usually very lighthearted and humorous.<br/>
		Gizmodo is designed so that the most recently posted posts will appear as the first thing you see, with older ones available if you scroll further down the page.  Towards the end of the day, one particular post will typically be "highlighted" as the first one, with the rest below it in descending chronological order.  Each post typically has a large image, GIF, or video accompanying it as an attention grabber.  The site has a plain white background and has a sidebar at the left that links to popular stories on the site today, as well as popular stories within its network.  Gizmodo is fairly consistent with how it treats other pages within the site: when you click the link to a specific post, you see that full post, plus a comment section at the bottom, but the sidebar containing popular posts does not go away.  In that way, it can be difficult to navigate, since you need to either hit "back" on your browser or scroll to the top of the page and click the "Gizmodo" banner to return home. <br/>
		I typically can find a lot of things to read on the site, as well as images and videos to view, and I think the site does a good job of conveying the fun-loving, time-wasting attitude many of its posts  and writers have.  I mentioned that I don't like a lot of flashing images or distractions on my news websites, but when I visit Gizmodo, I'm typically not looking for serious stories so having distractions is okay!
