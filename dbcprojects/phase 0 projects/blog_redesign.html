					<hr>

					<p>Oh, hello there.  I've spent a good part of the last week redesigning my website.  I know this will be a long process and I expect to continually be adding things to it (not just content but cool design features!) but I hope it's in a good state right now.</p>
					<p>What struck me is that I had no idea how I actually wanted my site to look.  I guess I don't really consider WHAT makes a website user-friendly or makes the UX enjoyable; rather, I know when I like a website and when I don't like a website.  Translating that to my personal site was more challenging though.  I decided to search through a lot of professional pages and see how they approached things (without any outright stealing, of course).  Most of the better sites I saw were for people advertising their web design skills (surprise surprise) and I know I am not very good at that stuff, so I decided to go for simplicity and readability.</p>
					<p>I made a lot of the site using <a href = "http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> which made the process much easier.  I also played around a bit with some graphical features in jQuery, some of which made it into the site (for example on my blog welcome page) and others that are still a work in progress.  Until now I hadn't really given too much thought to my site, unfortunately, but now I do feel like I want it to look nice and have people be impressed when they visit.  I have not yet optimized it for different browser sizes or anything like that</p>
					<p>Anyway, if you the reader has any suggestions (or finds any bugs, which there are probably still some) please let me know!</p>
