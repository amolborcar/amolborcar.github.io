                <h4 class="blog-subheading">Pairing</h4>

                <p class="blog-question">What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</p>

                <p>
                    I thought it was interesting pairing to solve challenges, and usually more difficult than I would have thought. I actually thought all my paired challenges went really well and I had good chemistry with my pairs each time, but I just figuring out roles and being on the same page was more challenging than I thought it would be.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-question">Was something particularly fun or rewarding?</p>

                <p>
                    Not necessarily fun, but I was interested to see what other people were very good at or had a strong knowledge of relative to me, and conversely what they didn't have as good of a grasp of as I did. For example, I felt comfortable with creating and manipulating objects in JavaScript, while other people seemed to have a better grasp of CSS and creating functions.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-question">Was something frustrating and difficult for you?</p>

                <p>
                    Honestly, no, there wasn't anything really frustrating. Other than issues with Google Hangouts or Stypi or bad Internet connections, I enjoyed all my pairing sessions.
                </p>

                <h4 class="blog-subheading">Feedback</h4>


                <p class="blog-question">How did you feel when you read your feedback?</p>


                <p class="blog-question">Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?</p>


                <p class="blog-question">Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?</p>

                <p>
                    Apparently none of my feedback has been rated by other students yet, so I can't really answer these questions.</p>
                <p>
                    <span style="text-decoration: underline">Added the following on May 27, 2014</span>: So far I think the feedback I've received has been helpful. Mostly it has centered on two things I already knew I needed to work on (emphasis on pseudocoding and just slowing down and not thinking too far ahead), so it's good that the feedback is reinforcing what I already thought were my weaknesses.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-question">How was it to write feedback?</p>

                <p>
                    Writing feedback, like pairing, was more difficult than I thought. After a good session I had to wrack my brain to find critiques or things my pair could improve on, and at the same time I didn't want to sound too harsh in articulating those things. I was trying to be specific but it is difficult to be specific without giving away who I am or which session I'm talking about.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-question">What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?</p>

                <p>
                    Again, the hardest thing was articulating my thoughts without sounding unkind or wording it in an unspecific way that isn't particularly helpful to anyone. Also, for example if I suggested something, trying to describe how much of an issue I thought the behavior was (a big issue or a minor issue) was pretty difficult to articulate.
