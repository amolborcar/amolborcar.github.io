					<h2 class = "blog-title"> Feedback </h2>
					<h3 class = "blog-date"> June 1, 2014 </h3>
					<hr>

					<p>My prompt for this week is to evaluate the feedback I've given and received during my time in Phase 0, to see what I felt worked and what didn't work, and to figure out some strategies for giving live feedback, which we'll start doing during Phase 1.</p>
					<p>I always feel that feedback is really useful when it contains something actionable.  "Great job, keep it up" is very nice to see, but I know that I'm not perfect and would prefer if people tell me something that I can improve on.  When giving feedback I try to include one thing every time, even though I know that any suggestion carries some negative implication.  I usually try to phrase it as something that we as a pair had trouble with, as opposed to singling out just the other person.  Or if it's something we talked about during our pairing session, I feel more comfortable suggesting that as something to work on.</p>
					<p>I haven't really gotten any negative feedback yet (or maybe I just haven't seen it) and I feel like I actually  have taken a lot out of the feedback people have left me.  Usually the things I see, such as slowing down or focusing on pseudocoding at the beginning, are things that I kind of know I need to work on, which I think is a good sign that I have a decent perception of my own weaknesses.</p>
					<p>As far as giving live feedback, that is an entirely different animal.  I imagine it will be pretty awkward, and I don't know how logistically to handle this.  Do I interrupt the person?  Do we decide beforehand that after an hour we'll give feedback for 10 minutes? Do I hold back some criticisms that I may have, or be completely forthcoming?  I have no idea!  I've given live feedback before informally, and I've had both positive and negative experiences.  I've found that no matter how much someone says they like hearing feedback, which almost everyone says, many people don't handle it all that well.  In those instances I usually hold back, but I know that's not the most constructive thing to do.</p>
					<p>My strategy at the beginning will be to try to map out a feedback process with my partner/group, then adapt based on how well that's working.  Since there are about 20 of us in my DBC cohort, each of us will have different styles and hopefully after a few weeks I'll know everyone a lot better and will have different systems for different people.  And hopefully I don't have any super awkward moments!</p>
