                <img class="blogimage" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TJf_U9bChnQ/TgNt_Gs--JI/AAAAAAAAApY/H9M8TqpuHT4/s1600/stereotyping.gif" />

                <p>
                    I think we're all aware of what stereotype threat is and the basics of how it manifests. Basically, stereotype threat is the feeling that someone is seeing you through the lens of a certain stereotype, and your behavior is affected in some way. So, for example, if someone assumes you are going to be bad at math because of your race or gender, you might respond by not trying as hard at math since less is expected of you anyway. That, at least, is the prevailing theory and the feared reaction to being stereotyped.

                <p>
                    I'm not going to pretend I've never experienced stereotype threat. I'm Indian-American, so while growing up I had this exact same conversation approximately 14,000 times with family friends:
                    <br/>
                    <br/>Q: So what do you want to be? A doctor?
                    <br/>A: Not really.
                    <br/>Q: An engineer, like your dad!
                    <br/>A: Nope!
                    <br/>Q: Computer science?
                    <br/>A: Nah, not that either. (I obviously changed my mind about this later...)
                    <br/>Q: Oh...well...uhhh...what do you want to do?
                    <br/>
                    <br/>Fun times! The part I enjoyed most about those conversations, which clearly projected Indian stereotypes onto me, were that the most egregious examples were from other Indian people. They had a few career paths that they thought "made sense" for "someone like me" and when I chose to go in a different direction, they were confused. Not angry, not disappointed, just puzzled. I'm pretty sure that now, 3 years after I've graduated with a degree in Finance, my dad is still holding out hope I'll go into chemical engineering.

                    Since moving to California, I've also noticed that people make strange assumptions when I tell them I'm from Louisiana, or that I went to school in Texas. I sadly consider myself lucky not to have a thick southern accent, just because people definitely associate a southern accent with being less intelligent (to put it politely), even though there are

                <p>
                    In terms of combating the threat, I think I've personally just ignored it. I don't like to associate with people who can't look past skin color, gender, height, or whatever superficial characteristic when interacting with someone. When I was younger I definitely let it affect me more. For example, one reason I didn't want to major in engineering was because I had people pushing me to do it (also I really really really suck at Chemistry and Physics). Having grown up more though I just try to do the best I can and let the results speak for themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think that personally I won't have a problem being taken seriously in the Bay Area (though as I mentioned in last week's blog, plenty of others might). If someone really lets his or her stereotypes influence decisions then there's probably not much I can say to change them, and honestly it's not worth my time or effort. I will do the best I can, like I always try to, and if they still don't want to listen then there are plenty of other people in the world who will. And honestly, that's the advice I'd give to anyone else who feels threatened. Don't worry about what they say, you do your best, not for anyone else, just for yourself.
