                <h2 class="blog-title">Dealing with Conflict</h2>
                <h3 class="blog-date">April 25, 2014</h3>
                <hr>

                
                    <p class = "blog-question">Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</p>
                    <p>
                        The first thing that comes to mind is in college when I didn't get along with one of my roommates. There wasn't a specific event or anything that caused it, rather it was a pretty gradual straining of our relationship over time.
                    </p>
                    <p class = "blog-question">What was the source of the conflict?</p>
                    <p>
                        The source was really just a lot of his habits and behaviors that he had when we were roommates. We were good friends before living together, but of course I didn't know what he was like to live with. He would do things that drove me crazy, like not wash the dishes, play video games really loud late at night, and generally just be loud and distract me when I was trying to study. He wasn't trying to be annoying or intentionally trying to piss me off, which kind of made things worse because I couldn't get him to stop.
                    </p>
                    <p class = "blog-question">How did you handle that conflict?</p>
                    <p>
                        At first I would talk to him and ask him to stop doing certain things, such as leaving his things everywhere and yelling at the TV at night. I felt like I was making reasonable requests, but he just didn't stop. Again, it's not something he was consciously doing, and I guess he wasn't good about noticing when he was doing those things. After asking him for a long time (probably months), I began just spending a lot more time out of the apartment and basically ignoring him and not interacting with him. In hindsight, that was pretty mean, since he was still friendly towards me, but I felt I had tried what I could.
                    </p>
                    <p class = "blog-question">Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</p>
                    <p>
                        My actions probably made things a little better because he definitely got the message about how I was feeling. However, as his behavior didn't really change, it's hard to say things got better.
                    </p>
                    <p class = "blog-question">If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</p>
                    <p>
                        The sad thing is, I'm not sure I would have done anything differently. I feel like I was pretty patient with him and if the same thing happened now and I was stuck in that situation, I think I would do the same thing. Looking at the Compass of Shame, I think my reaction was some combination of Withdrawal and Avoidance, which is probably how I most often handle those types of situations.
                    </p>
                    <p class = "blog-question">What did you learn from this experience?</p>
                    <p>This isn't a very satisfying answer, but I think I learned that some people just aren't a good fit together and that some people don't change their behavior. I haven't had a problem with any other roommates or anything, so I think it was just a case of bad fit.
                    </p>
