                <p>
                    As the great Elaine Benes once said, our goal should be a society without classes. Unfortunately, even Ruby isn't perfect in this regard. Every object in Ruby is an instance of some sort of class, whether user-created or built-in. The purpose of a class is to grant objects that have similar qualities access to a common group of methods. An example of a built-in class is the Object class. Every new object that is created has, by default, access to the methods that are made by the Object class. For example, if we create a new object, we can see all methods that can be performed on it:
                    <br/>
                </p>
                <div class="codeblock">
                    my_obj = Object.new
                    <span class="comment"># This creates a new instance of the Object class.</span>
                    <br/>puts my_obj.methods.sort
                    <span class="comment"># This lists out all methods available on the Object class.</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Classes are a great way to give properties to new objects based on their characteristics in common with other objects. For example, let's say I've obtained a time machine. With this time machine, I've decided to travel back to 1998 and open a video rental store to get rich. I want to create a record of all movies that my store has in inventory. For this, I'll create a new class called Movie.
                </p>
                <div class="codeblock">
                    class Movie
                    <br/>
                    <span style="margin-left:30px">def initialize(title, year)
                        <span class="comment"># create an instance of the class with two inputs.</span>
                        <br/>
                    </span>
                    <span style="margin-left: 60px">@title = title
                        <br/>
                        <span>
                            <span style="margin-left: 60px">@year = year
                                <span class="comment"># Create two instance variables, which in this case are unique to each movie
                                    <br/>
                                </span>
                            </span>
                            <span style="margin-left: 30px">end
                                <br/>
                            </span>

                            <span style="margin-left: 30px">def describe</span>
                            <br/>
                            <span style="margin-left: 60px">puts "#{@title} was made in {@year}" end
                                <br/>
                            </span>
                            <span style="margin-left: 30px">end</span>
                            <br/>end
                            <br/>
                            <br/>movie1 = Movie.new("The Shawshank Redemption", 1994)
                            <br/>movie2 = Movie.new("The Usual Suspects", 1995)
                </div>

                <p>
                    Each movie that I created is a new
                    <strong>instance</strong> of the class.
                    <em>Initialize</em> is a method that is run automatically when a new object is created. In my case, the
                    <em>initialize</em> method takes the two input variables and creates instance variables, unique to that instance of the class, with their values. The
                    <em>describe</em> method puts the resulting sentence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So now I have a record of what movies I have in stock. When I have them in the storeroom, I sort them by title and year (hence those variables as inputs). However, when I put them on display for rental, I sort them by genre. Instead of creating a new class that takes the two original variables (title and year) along with a new one (genre), I can create a subclass of Movie that automatically inherits
                    <span class="codeline">Movie</span>'s variables and requires a unique input of its own.
                </p>
                <div class="codeblock">
                    class RentalMovie < Movie<br/>
                    <span style="margin-left:30px">def initialize(title, year, genre)
                        <span class="comment"># create an instance of the class with three inputs.</span>
                        <br/>
                    </span>
                    <span style="margin-left: 60px">super(title, year)
                        <span class="comment"># Inherit the title and year variables from Movie.</span>
                        <br/>
                        <span>
                            <span style="margin-left: 60px">@genre = genre</span>
                            <br/>
                            <span style="margin-left: 30px">end</span>
                            <br/>

                            <span style="margin-left:30px">def describe
                                <br/>
                            </span>

                            <span style="margin-left: 60px">super
                                <span class="comment"># this inherits the super method from the Movie class.</span>
                            </span>
                            <br/>

                            <span style="margin-left: 30px">end</span>
                            <br/>end
                </div>
                <p>
                    The super command in the above methods is instructing each method to inherit the same method's commands from the parent class. In this case, the parent class of
                    <span class="codeline">RentalMovie</span> is
                    <span class="codeline">Movie</span>. So in this case, the program will search through the
                    <span class="code">Movie</span> class for methods named
                    <em>initialize</em> and
                    <em>describe</em> and pass those instructions to the
                    <span class="codeline">RentalMovie</span> class. So in this case, the
                    <em>initialize</em> method is now creating instance variables for @title and @year, in addition to @genre (which is created directly in the
                    <span class="codeline">RentalMovie</span> class). The
                    <em>describe</em> method is doing the same thing in
                    <span class="codeline">RentalMovie</span> that it did in
                    <span class="codeline">Movie</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This concept is known as
                    <strong>inheritance</strong>. Inheritance is a good way to make your code DRY (don't repeat yourself) and to help categorizing objects. Organizing objects into classes and subclasses is a good way to make sure that similar methods can be performed on similar objects. I used a movie store example here, but any number of programs could benefit from classes and subclasses. For example, a Zoo might want to track all the animals it houses as the same class, and then be able to perform slightly different methods for different types (or subclasses) of animals (such as mammals vs. amphibians vs. birds). Inheritance is a way to avoid having to create brand new methods for each subclass.
