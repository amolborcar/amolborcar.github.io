		<strong>Exercise 1:</strong> The terms that come to mind are Accomplishment, Adventure, Decisiveness, Growth, and Personal Development.  These all have to do with my feelings of restlessness whenever I feel like I'm not growing or developing in some way and are all part of the basis for my doing Dev Bootcamp.
