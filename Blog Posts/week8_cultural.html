		<h2> Dev Bootcamp's Culture </h2>
		<h3> May 25, 2014 </h3>
		<p> 
			The task this week was to watch a fireside chat given by DBC founder Shereef Bishay to a group of Phase 0 students, then write about my opinion about DBC's culture and how I fit.  I'll be honest, I went into Shereef's fireside chat video thinking "oh great, I have to watch this video for an hour about stuff I've already heard before."  However, the video answered a lot of questions and uncertainties that I still had about DBC and I felt very reassured by both his answers and the honesty with which he gave them.
		</p>
		<p>
			Regarding DBC's culture and the overall experience, the video honestly made me much more excited about it.  He emphasized that DBC does not abide by the traditional (at least, the traditional American) way of teaching students: specifically, you sit and listen while the teacher teaches, and then you work on stuff by yourself.  Rather, everything we work on is encouraged to be done in pairs or small groups, and there isn't really such a thing as "cheating" or "plagiarizing" as we normally think of it.  Someone during the chat asked if taking a piece of someone else's code is considered "plagiarizing."  That is a concern that I have had several times in Phase 0, and Shereef explained that no, that is not plagiarizing, and in fact it's a big part of the learning process so they actually encourage it at DBC.  My entire life, any school setting I've been in has NOT been like that, and while I imagine it will take me a little while to adjust, I'm pretty sure I'll like it.
		</p>
		<p> 
			Shereef also discussed how DBC emphasizes collaboration over competition.  I think this makes sense, and I'm glad that is actually a point of emphasis because naturally, since we're all somewhat competing with each other for jobs (no matter how plentiful they are in the Bay Area), we might be a bit reticent about asking for help or hesitant to help others who we might later see interviewing against us for a job.  A recurring theme (and title of the video) was that DBC should be like a kitchen, where everyone's input, including the students', is welcome to make the best possible product.  That's very refreshing to hear, and I'm glad they recognize that the curriculum they have now isn't perfect and never will be, so they welcome suggestions.
		</p>
		<p>
			I think it's pretty clear from what I've said that I really like the attitude and culture of DBC from what I heard in the fireside chat.  I naturally would be (and probably still will be) nervous about asking for help, for fear that I'm either a) falling behind, or b) showing weakness in front of my competition.  We've been raised from a young age to avoid doing that, to not admit that we don't have the answer.  Shereef pointed out that as we become adults, saying "I don't know" no longer is an acceptable answer to a question, which is why many of us, myself included, try to BS our way through a lot of situations.  I'm really looking forward to being able to admit what I don't know, because I think being in denial about not understanding something limits how well we are able to engage with new material.  I've focused during Phase 0 on trying to go in with a blank slate and learn from everyone around me, since almost everything about this is new to me, and I'm glad to see that type of mindset is encouraged.
