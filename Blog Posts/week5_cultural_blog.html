		<h2> Lack of Diversity in the Tech World </h2>
		<h3> May 4, 2014 </h3>
		<img class = "blogimage" src = "http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA0LzA2LzExL3NpbGljb252YWxsLjM4MTIxLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTk1MHg1MzQjCmUJanBn/08254e6a/15f/silicon-valley-cast.jpg" />
		<h4> The Problem </h4>
		<p>
			When I think of problems facing the tech world, the first thing that comes to mind is that the tech world has a perception problem in many parts of the country.  I've lived in San Francisco for almost 3 years, and I get asked by friends and family members who live elsewhere what the city is like.  A lot of them assume that SF is full of young, entitled people who are using their parents' money to fund a dumb startup.  Well-off kids from good private schools starting a new mobile gaming company, that's the idea a lot of people have of the Bay Area.  However, anyone who lives here knows that not everyone is like that.  There are some people like that, obviously, but the tech world is full of people from very diverse backgrounds and with a variety of interests and talents.  However, the ones that get the most press (I'm looking at you, <a href = "http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-01-30/facebook-turns-10-the-mark-zuckerberg-interview">Zuckerberg</a>) fit the bill. 
		</p>
		<h4> Background </h4>
		<p>
			It's not like this perception just came out of thin air.  There are a lot of people who fit that description, and it's led to people assuming that the tech scene, especially in the Bay Area, is a place that's only open to a select few groups of people.  There have been concerns about <a href = "http://www.newrepublic.com/article/117088/silicons-valleys-brutal-ageism">ageism</a>, with people saying that some tech companies consider young people to be "smarter" and that they consider high energy and enthusiasm to be better than actual experience or knowledge.  Somehow, even people like the aforementioned Mark Zuckerberg, who just a few years ago was <a href = "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">the poster boy</a> for Ivy Leaguers getting rich quick by starting a tech company, are <a href = "http://valleywag.gawker.com/is-mark-zuckerberg-too-old-to-run-facebook-1563798730">now seen as being too old for the industry, and he's not even 30!</a>.  Silicon Valley is seen as a boys' club, with only about <a href = "http://www.ncwit.org/blog/did-you-know-demographics-technical-women">23% of programming jobs</a> being held by women, compared to <a href = "http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat11.htm">about 57% of all professional jobs</a>.  In addition, the large majority of jobs in Silicon Valley are held by Caucasians and Asian-Americans, with <a href = "http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_22094415/asian-workers-now-dominate-silicon-valley-tech-jobs">some estimates saying over 90% of tech jobs</a> are held by them.
		</p>
		<h4> Potential Solutions </h4>
		<p>
			I suppose if I had a solution to this problem, I could make a lot of money without ever writing a single program!  The tech world risks having the same type of perception problem that Wall Street is currently facing, that it is only full of young, self involved get-rich-quick types who live in their own bubble world.  
		</p>
		<p>
			My first suggestion is to be more open about the problem.  One thing I noticed while researching this problem is that many tech companies in the Bay Area don't release demographic information about their companies, probably to avoid this problem altogether.  <a href = "http://money.cnn.com/2013/03/17/technology/diversity-silicon-valley/">CNNMoney attempted to collect this data for a study</a>; they asked 20 prominent tech companies to provide the racial and gender makeup of their employees.  Only 17 complied, the rest declined to turn over their data.  Now, it's possible that these companies are very diverse with their hiring, but the fact that they didn't play ball just makes it seem like they've got something to hide.

		<div class = "caption"> Seriously, who the hell thought this was a good idea??? </div>
		<p>
			So far people seem to have responded to this trend with mostly sarcasm and jokes.  Shows like HBO's Silicon Valley (highly recommended!) make fun of the people you see in the tech world.  However, as the problem persists, it has the potential to become worse and worse until there finally is a breaking point.  For example, I saw a new website called <a href = "https://codebabes.com/">Codebabes</a> claims that it will tech you how to code while looking at hot girls.  This is not only one of the stupidest and most offensive things I've seen become popular, but it plays exactly into people's negative stereotypes of the Bay Area as being out of touch with reality and completely un-self aware (self unaware?).  <a href = "http://gizmodo.com/code-babes-is-everything-wrong-with-tech-culture-plus-1567643195">Various</a> <a href = "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/28/codebabes-coding-site-sexily-clad-ladies_n_5225809.html">sites</a> have been destroying the idea and calling out its may flaws and, in true Internet form, creating hilarious <a href = "http://codedicks.com/">parody sites</a>.  Things like this could lead to simple parodies and jokes turning into something much more negative.
		</p>
		<p>
			After people see how widespread and serious the problem actually is, we can begin addressing it.  Scholarships and special programs for women and minorities interested in tech are becoming more commonplace, which will help, but as the tech industry becomes more attractive and salaries increase, we need to get a handle on the problem and nip it in the bud.
