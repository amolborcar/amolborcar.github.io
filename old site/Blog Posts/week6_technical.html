		<h2> Functional vs. Object Oriented Programming </h2>
		<h3> May 11, 2014 </h3>

		<p>
			Today I'll compare Functional programming and Object Oriented Programming (OOP).  I'll try to wedge in no more than 25 OOPs...I Did It Again jokes, but no promises.  One thing I noticed while doing my research is that people on the Internet seem to be VERY passionate about which type is better.  Even the Wikipedia article on OOP has a note about the neutrality of the article.  Good times.
		</p>

		<p>
			Object Oriented Programming languages, including Ruby, which we've been introduced to the last few weeks, operate by manipulating "objects".  Objects have data fields (also called properties) that describe the object and their own sets of procedures that can be performed on the object, called methods.  OOP is thought to be more user friendly than earlier programming practices.  Because each item is its own object, OOP is meant to create code that is more streamlined and eliminates repetition.  The same methods can be performed on multiple objects, eliminating the need to repeat steps, and objects can usually be modified in different parts of the code, eliminating the need to constantly jump around within the code.  As long as the programmer understands how the objects operate, updating or modifying the code also should be fairly straightforward.  OOP has become more popular in recent years, and the growing popularity of object-oriented languages like Python and Ruby have contributed to this trend.
		</p>
		<p>
			The DBC assignment said that some people consider Functional Programming to be the opposite of OOP.  I kind of agree with that sentiment, after having read about it.  Functional Programming is derived from the Lambda calculus, and it basically treats its procedures as mathematical functions.  My understanding is that because Functional Programming does not have (or does not build around) objects, there are no properties of the object to change.  Rather, a new function is created to work off your previous functions, and they keep building on one another.  My first thought is this seems like it would be a) slow, and b) very confusing.  However, critics of OOP claim that Functional Programming is more efficient, because you don't have a lot of unneeded objects or methods created and just hanging out while you're working on something else.  I honestly had never heard of most of the pure functional languages I read about (Hope, Rex, Lisp, Scheme, Racket, F#) but a lot of languages, namely Python, take some elements of functional programming, so my impression is that pure functional languages are mostly only used in academia and hardcore subject-specific programs like Mathematica.

			It's hard to find a good explanation of the pros and cons of each, because as I mentioned earlier it seems like people are very passionate and defensive about whatever programming paradigm they prefer.  It seems to come down to how you view the relationship between the data and the operations you want to create or perform.  In OOP, procedures (methods) interact directly with the object and can manipulate the data which is itself a part of the object.  Whereas in FP, the function is the main thing you're working with and it can be applied to a variety of data structures.  SQL, which is used everywhere for data management, is built under FP principles, and it typically interacts with OOP languages (such as Ruby or Python), so the two can work together very well.  So at the end of the day, it comes down to the person doing it.  That's the thing about coding, it all about the people :)
