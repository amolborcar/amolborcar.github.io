            <h2>Reaffirming My Values</h2>
            <h3>May 17, 2014</h3>
            <p>
                In my <a href="http://amolborcar.github.io/Blog%20Posts/week1_cultural.html" target="blank">Week 1 post</a>, I described my values as being Accomplishment, Adventure, Decisiveness, Growth, and Personal Development. As I think of how these relate to my conceptualization of stereotype threat, the ones that stick out to me are Accomplishment and Personal Development. I said <a href="http://amolborcar.github.io/Blog%20Posts/week6_cultural.html" target="blank">last week</a> that I want my work and my accomplishments to speak for themselves, and if people cannot accept me after that then they aren't worth my time.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have no idea right now how people are stereotyping me or how they will do so as I start my career as a programmer, but I do know that changing someone's mind about me by my doing a great job on something would lead to a huge sense of accomplishment. That's one of the ways I can really know I've done a great job: someone not only tells you, but it changes something about
                <em>them</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In relation to personal development, my understanding and the way I relate to stereotypes is one way that I've developed as a person. I mentioned last week that I used to let stereotypes get to me and do my best not to fall into those buckets that people wanted to lump me into. As I've gotten older and wiser, I've learned simply not to care. My doing DBC is pretty evident of that, because my learning to be a programmer is the opposite of running from a stereotype. However, I'm not doing it to fit into a preconceived notion of myself, and I'm not doing it in order to be defiant; rather, I'm doing it because I think it's the best move for me and will make me happy and give me a more fulfilling career.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know there will be times at DBC when I feel like I'm in over my head, falling behind, or wondering what I'm doing there. That comes with the territory, and if I don't ever feel that way I don't think I'll be getting the most out of it, honestly. I've felt that way before, and my response has typically been to take a step back and remind myself why I'm here and what the end goal is. I've usually found that just taking a step back, even for one night or just a few hours, then coming back with a fresh brain and fresh eyes helps tremendously, not just with actually solving the problem at hand but with my motivation to actually accomplish the task. I've dealt with being overworked before, and I don't know if this is true for everyone, but usually all I really need is a good night's sleep and I'm ready to jump back into it!
